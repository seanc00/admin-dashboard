# Admin Dashboard Project

This project is a fully-coded **Admin Dashboard** created to demonstrate my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and specifically **CSS Grid**. The dashboard includes essential UI components like a sidebar, header, and main content area, all organized to simulate a functional, user-friendly interface.

## Skills Demonstrated

- ### HTML & CSS
   Structuring and styling a comprehensive dashboard layout.

- ### CSS Grid
   Crafting complex, nested grid layouts to achieve precise element placement.

- ### Design Implementation
   Translating a design file into a fully coded dashboard interface without relying on frameworks or libraries.

The finished project showcases my front-end development abilities, especially my expertise in creating custom layouts with CSS Grid.
